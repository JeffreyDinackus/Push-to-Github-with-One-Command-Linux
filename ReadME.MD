Install by copying and pasting script into (dependant on distro potentially) .bashrc.

Restart all terminals. Then use command: 

pp "commit message"

pp obviously stands for power push

for the clone script, use

gc repository-link.git

gc stands for git clone

It will add commit and push in one command
